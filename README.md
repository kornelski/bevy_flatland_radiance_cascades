# Flatlang Radiance Cascades â€” very vanilla implementation

Simulates lights in 2D scenes, with soft shadows.

Unfinished, buggy. I'm a noob in shader graphics, and don't quite know what I'm doing. Based on Rust/Bevy.

 - no pre-averaging (yet)
 - no bilinear fix
 - no mipmaps
 - no SDFs even (naively marches density map)
 - no proper bounce light (can this even work without SDFs?)
 - 2x ray growth factor, not 4x, because that's what the paper promised!

See `src/cascades.rs` and `cascades_*.wgsl` shaders in `assets/`.
